# Project Cron Automations

Project automations extend the existing sidebar automation UI from thread-scoped heartbeat records to project-scoped cron records.

## Storage

Project automations use Codex cron automation TOML records with `cwds = ["<absolute project path>"]`. Sidebar display labels must be resolved to the real project folder before saving, so folder-name rows such as `TestChat` still write the scheduler-visible cwd. The UI/server reject unresolved non-absolute cwd values for project automation saves. Multi-cwd cron records keep their other cwd associations when edited or removed from one project, and the automation folder is deleted only when the final cwd association is removed. This matches Codex's project/folder automation shape while preserving thread heartbeat records that use `target_thread_id`.

## UI

The sidebar project row dots menu exposes `Add automation…` or `Manage automations…`. The dialog reuses the thread automation manager style, including multiple automation selection, schedule presets, status, and remove/save behavior.

Project rows show the same compact automation icon when at least one project automation is attached. The top-level Automations panel lists both project cron automations and thread heartbeat automations together, sorts active automations before paused automations with newest records first inside each status group, and exposes edit buttons that open the shared automation editor.

## Boundaries

`Run now` remains available only for thread heartbeat automations because it queues a heartbeat message into a concrete thread. Project cron automations are scheduled against one or more working directories instead.
